# v2.2.0

MSPT: new submodule of Isoplot, able to analysis "pascal triangle" sample to validate experiment. (ref. Millard, Pierre, et al. 2014. “Isotopic Studies of Metabolic Systems by Mass Spectrometry: Using Pascal’s Triangle To Produce Biological Standards with Fully Controlled Labeling Patterns.” Analytical Chemistry 86 (20): 10288–95. https://doi.org/10.1021/ac502490g; https://github.com/llegregam/PascalTriangle)

# v2.0.0

Isoplot: New module to generate plot for isotopic MS data

# v1.10.0

Features added since last release:

    rbase graphics show faster rendering than ggplot.
    users can apply yaxis minimum / maximum limits and steps size, for ggplots figures and rbase graphics
    boxplot with ggstatsplots, pdf and image outputs
    metadata template based on features table
    vertical / horizontal display, labels size control for ggplot outputs.
    download all boxplots in png/jpg format in a single archive
    button to download tests datasets
    widget to output specific features
    conditionnal popping buttons avoiding confusion
    new button to download all ACP files run / update ACP with one button.

Fixs:

    metadata filters
    disabling statistics tests when plotting individuals boxplots.


# v1.5.0

    New widget allowing user to sum quantification of compounds belonging the same group
    PCA: combining factors, display ellipses or not
    Boxplots: pngs output for each graphic
    fixes

# v1.4.1

add new input modules with filters widgets (datamods package) add options for boxplots: coloring boxplots, custom y axis label, inform outliers or not, and reordering/stashing boxplot conditions (sortable package) modularizing code +debug 1.4.0

# v1.3.2 

# v1.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
